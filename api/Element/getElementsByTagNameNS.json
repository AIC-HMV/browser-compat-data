                "The behavior of `element.getElementsByTagNameNS` changed between Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. In Firefox 3.5 and before, this function would automatically case-fold any queries so that a search for \"foo\" would match \"Foo\" or \"foo\". In Firefox 3.6 and later this function is now case-sensitive so that a query for \"foo\" will only match \"foo\" and not \"Foo\". For more background on this, please see the [comment from Henri Sivonen about the change](https://bugzil.la/542185#c5). You can also look at the [relevant part of the standard, which states which parts of the API are case-sensitive and which parts aren't](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Case_Sensitivity_in_class_and_id_Names).",
